# You Make a Game

# Requirements:

	# 1. Make a different game from the one I made.
	# 2. Use more than one file, and use import to use them both.
	# 3. Use one class per room and give the classes names that fit their purpose (like GoldRoom).
	# 4. Your runner will need to know about these rooms, so make a class that runs them and knows about them. There's plenty of ways to do this, but consider having each room return what room is next or setting a variable of what room is next.
	
Game Ideas: each room has a sub-game, which you have to win to keep going. Sub-games:
	- Guess the number (hi/lo)
	- Trivia (??)
	- Rock-Paper-Scissors
	- Hangman
