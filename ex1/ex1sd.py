# Study Drills

# (1) Make your script print another line.
print "Here is another line."

# (2) Make your script print only one of the lines.

# print "Hello World!"
# print "Hello Again"
# print "I like typing this."
print "This is fun."
# print 'Yay! Printing.'
# print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
# print 'I "said" do not touch this.'

# (3) Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.

# The octothorpe (#) is the comment symbol. Code on a line after the # won't run.
