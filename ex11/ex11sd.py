# # Asking questions

# # Most of what software does is the following:
# # 	1. Take some kind of input from a person.
# # 	2. Change it.
# # 	3. Print out something to show how it changed.

# print "How old are you?",
# age = raw_input()
# print "How tall are you?",
# height = raw_input()
# print "How much do you weigh?",
# weight = raw_input()

# print "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (age, height, weight)

# STUDY DRILLS

print "What is your name?"
name = raw_input("--> ")
print "Hello, %s." % name
